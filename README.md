# slack-angryreacter
A bot I built for Slack for fun to joke around with friends

- when set up with Slack API keys and tokens for your team and a user ID for one specific user, the bot will angry react (Facebook react emoji) to every post that user makes
- you can optionally configure the bot to react in any emoji available to your team! Just change the REACTION_EMOJI_NAME environment variable to the name of the Slack emoji
